/*
  # Restrict admin and receptionist permissions for medical records

  1. Changes
    - Add DELETE policy for employees to delete records from their branch
    - Prevent admins from updating biopsy-related fields
    - Prevent admins from deleting records

  2. Security
    - Employees can only delete records from their assigned branch
    - Admins cannot delete records
    - Admins can only update pdf_en_ready status
